This project will outline my experiences with flexbox that I learned during the curriculum of the Odin Project. I will have outlined practical application of flexbox and basic HTML, as well as CSS, by the end of this project.

Having completed the start of the project, I've made a comparison folder "./finished_product" to compare between the initial design given by the Odin Project and my own accomplished website.
